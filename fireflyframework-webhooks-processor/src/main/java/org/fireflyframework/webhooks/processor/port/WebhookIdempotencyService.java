/**
 * Port interface for webhook idempotency/deduplication service.
 * <p>
 * This service ensures that webhook events are processed exactly once,
 * even when multiple workers are running in a cluster (autoscaling).
 * <p>
 * <b>Use Cases:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Prevent duplicate processing when Kafka rebalances consumer groups</li>
 *   <li>Handle at-least-once delivery semantics from message queue</li>
 *   <li>Ensure idempotency during worker autoscaling</li>
 *   <li>Prevent race conditions when multiple workers pick the same event</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Implementation Strategies:</b>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Redis-based:</b> Use Redis SET NX with TTL for distributed locking</li>
 *   <li><b>Database-based:</b> Use unique constraints on event_id with processed_at timestamp</li>
 *   <li><b>Event Store-based:</b> Query event store for processing status</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <b>Example Implementation (Redis):</b>
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * @Component
 * public class RedisWebhookIdempotencyService implements WebhookIdempotencyService {
 *     
 *     private final ReactiveRedisTemplate<String, String> redisTemplate;
 *     
 *     @Override
 *     public Mono<Boolean> tryAcquireProcessingLock(UUID eventId, Duration lockDuration) {
 *         String key = "webhook:processing:" + eventId;
 *         return redisTemplate.opsForValue()
 *             .setIfAbsent(key, "locked", lockDuration)
 *             .defaultIfEmpty(false);
 *     }
 *     
 *     @Override
 *     public Mono<Void> markAsProcessed(UUID eventId, Duration ttl) {
 *         String key = "webhook:processed:" + eventId;
 *         return redisTemplate.opsForValue()
 *             .set(key, "processed", ttl)
 *             .then();
 *     }
 * }
 * }
