 * Domain event representing a webhook that was rejected or failed processing.

 * - Failed validation (signature, IP whitelist, payload size, etc.)
 * - Failed processing after max retries
 * - Encountered unrecoverable errors
 * <p>
 * The DLQ allows for:
 * - Manual inspection and debugging of failed webhooks
